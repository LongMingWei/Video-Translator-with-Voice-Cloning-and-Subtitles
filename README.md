# About
- Translates a video with voice cloning and subtitle generation included.
- Made with Python, OpenVoice/Whisper and Gradio.

# How to use
- Upload a video from your device or a YouTube URL, and select a language to translate to. If it's the same language as the video, only subtitles will be generated with the original audio kept.
- The resulting video can be downloaded after a successful translation.
